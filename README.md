# Hörsaal-Coffe-DLC
You would like a cheaky coffe, hot coco or tea during Master Drmotoa‘s lecture, but you can only put it on the dirty floor? Look no further, with the Coffe DLC you can have your bewrage of choice next to you during lectures!

# Print it yourself!
HCD is 3D printed, and optimised for FDM printers, if you are lucky bastard and have one at home, just download the stl and print it. If not you can have it printed at the Fachschaft for materialcost. You also need an anti slip surface on the bottom, so it doas not slip. I use griptape for skateboards, because its awsome, but use whatever you want. Legends glue it to the tabels. 

# Buy it from me
If you want to support the project and my future work you can buy it from me for material costs plus workcost.

# Support my work
Donate me so I can afford to put coffe on my own DLC tyty ^^
