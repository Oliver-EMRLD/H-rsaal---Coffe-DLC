# Hörsaal-coaster
You would like a cheaky coffe, hot coco or tea during Master Drmotoa‘s lecture :3, but you can only put it on the dirty floor where you will inevitably spill it on your stuff? Look no further, with the Hörsaal-coaster you can have your bewrage of choice next to you during thoose long lectures! It provides a perfectly leveled surface for your cup or flask, so it doas not spill or slides down into your lap.

# Print it yourself!
HC is 3D printed, and optimised for FDM printers, if you are lucky bastard and have one at home, just download the stl and print it. If not you can have it printed at the Fachschaft for materialcost. You also need an anti slip surface on the bottom, so it doas not slide down from the table. I use griptape for skateboards, because its good shit, but use whatever you want. If you are a legend you superglue it to the table.
